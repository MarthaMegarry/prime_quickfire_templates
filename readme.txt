I am having trouble getting the form to hook up to the POST call to hook up to the JSON object... there is something I am just not getting about this.

Now something is happening where everything is crashing when I submit the form...but it is pushing an undefined object to the DOM? So that's progress!

Also why can't I get Jquery to work unless I pull it in from outside?
